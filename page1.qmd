## About Me

I am Prawanth Reddy Talasani currently pursuing Master of Science in Data Analytics Engineering in George Mason University. I completed my under graduation in Electronics and Communication Engineering in July 2023 from Vellore institute of technology-Vellore.(VIT UNIVERSITY)

My education goals in this course to gain knowledge in statistical analyzing techniques and should be able to analyze large data sets to support data driven decision making. I had chosen data analytics because of its high demand in the market and it is a fast expanding field for a employee to grow in his career path.

Being an undergraduate in ECE , I am familiar with both hardware as well as software. I studied various computing environments which include Python, Java, HTML, Multisim, LT spice and R language. I am excited to learn new concepts and technologies.
